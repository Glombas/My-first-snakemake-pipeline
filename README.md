# My-first-snakemake-pipeline
This repository serves as an educational tool for anyone wanting to learn how to build pipelines with Snakemake but lacks the time to look for a suitable dataset or the time to think what they want to build.

The main point is to create a "scaffold" that you can then build upon fairly quickly based on your needs.

I will use publicly available data that you can download or substitute for your own if you want!

We will build a small pipeline that will go through the first steps of Differential Gene Expression analysis:
1. Quality Check -> read mapping -> outputting statistics of the mapping

## First of all!
- I based this tutorial on the knowledge that I got from a youtube tutorial [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@yclab438/videos). I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE TO WATCH IT AS WELL!!
